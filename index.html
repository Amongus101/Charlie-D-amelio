        <p>About
            Charli Grace D'Amelio (/dəˈmiːliːoʊ/; born May 1, 2004) is an American social media personality, voice actress and dancer. Born and raised in Norwalk, Connecticut, she was a competitive dancer for over 10 years before starting her social media career. She started actively posting content on the video-sharing app, TikTok, in late 2019, where she began posting dance videos to trending songs on the platform. She quickly amassed a large following and subsequently became the most-followed creator on the app, surpassing Loren Gray.

D'Amelio made her feature film debut with a voice role in the 2020 animated film StarDog and TurboCat, and will star in the Hulu docuseries The D'Amelio Show in 2021. Her other endeavors include a book, a podcast, a nail polish collection, and a makeup line. She is the first person to earn both 50 million and 100 million followers on TikTok and the second-highest earning TikTok personality according to Forbes. She has often been regarded as TikTok's "biggest star".D'Amelio first began posting on TikTok in May 2019 with a lip-syncing video alongside her friend. Her first video to gain traction, a side-by-side video (known on the platform as a "duet") with user "Move With Joy", was posted in July 2019. Since then, her content has mainly consisted of videos dancing to trending songs on the platform. In October 2019, she gained further exposure for her videos performing a dance called the "Renegade" to the K Camp song "Lottery", and was subsequently credited with popularizing the dance on social media.
